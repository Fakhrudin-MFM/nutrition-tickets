## Create navigation section

Navigation for the application is formed in the “Navigation” subsection in the sidebar. The main element of navigation for the future application is a section that groups menu items. To create a navigation section, go to the “Navigation” section and select the “+ Section” action, available on the work panel.

The create form opens and you need to fill in the system and logical name of the section, the display mode is set, in this case, by default. It makes sense to select the name of the navigation section in accordance with the principle of grouping the menu items included in this section. In this case, we group by topic of the application, since all existing menu items will be grouped into one section:

When you select this action, a form for creating a menu item opens, where you need to fill in the system and logical name and select the type of navigation. In this case, each navigation is a class page that was created earlier. Let's create a menu item for the “Tickets” class to display its objects:

The result in the system is as follows:

## Overriding the view form of a list of objects

Further, for each navigation item, you can specify an individual list view form  that can be different from the list view form  of objects of this class in other places of the system. To do this, simply add the attributes from the list below to the marked area.

In the same way, we create menu items to display the objects of the previously created classes. The result is as follows:
